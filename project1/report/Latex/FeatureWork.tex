Due to the lack of computing power we could not run a full experiments based on the whole dataset or try various datasets. There are other options to create features vector for image representation that can be explored, such as color histograms-based or Invariant feature mapping \cite{lampert2009kernel}. 
we have elided discussion of deep learning and neural network methodologies as it will be the second half of the half-term project. However, it will be interesting to compare the accuracy and time performances of the models. In addition, in experiment 6[\ref{experiment_6}] we compare the performance of SVM with different number of images in the chosen categories. Since we know that SVM preform good with (reletivly) small dataset, it will be interesting to extend this experiment with larger categories size and add neural network methodologies. Our intuition is that while using small category size SVM will outperform NN, NN will outperform SVM as the category size grows.
