Image classification problems usually imply a multi-class classification problem with high dimensional input data. Traditional classification methods are shown to generalize poorly on this kind of problems. One of the advantages of SVM is their good generalization performance, which is because it is a maximum margin classifier, that is making it more robust to outliers and noise. Therefore, it may outperform traditional classification methods like logistic regression or LDA in techniques such as image classification. In this project we will test SVM based image classification with the \textbf{Caltech 101}\cite{LiFergusPerona04} images dataset. From one side, we will test a couple of methods for image feature extraction that have proven to be robust for computer vision tasks, and then we will apply SVM classifier on the obtained features and try to tweak the kernel function and SVM hyperparameters to obtain the best possible accuracy on the classification.
